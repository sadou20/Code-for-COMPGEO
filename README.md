## Code for COMPGEO
 associated codes to my work
# why and how to use the code
the matlab code is related to the montecarlo probabilistic analysis
the probability of failure is calculated from stochastic mean and std of soil mechanical parameters 
10,000 simulations 
output figures: failure probability, FOS values
montecarlo simulation is used.

#other instructions
In the course of this study, a three-step computational and modeling approach was employed. Firstly, deterministic numerical analysis was conducted using the Geostudio software the report is int this repo (Deterministic analysis in Geostudio.html), specifically the Seep/W and Slope/W models from the Geostudio 2018 version. Secondly, Monte Carlo analysis was implemented using Matlab, and the source code for this analysis is accessible at this repo (code_prob_analysis). Lastly, AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) was developed through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool, which was created by Umit the process is on Mathworks repo (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/112140-automatic-machine-learning-toolbox), and the detailed procedural steps for its usage are elucidated in the manuscript. the"Outputs for Matlab AutoML" refer to the output report from AutoML simulations.
