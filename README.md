## Code for COMPGEO
 associated codes to my work
why and how to use the code
the matlab code is related to the montecarlo probabilistic analysis
the probability of failure is calculated from stochastic mean and std of soil mechanical parameters 
10,000 simulations 
output figures: failure probability, FOS values
montecarlo simulation is used.
